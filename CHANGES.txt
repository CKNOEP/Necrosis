February 28, 2026

CRITICAL FIXES
==============
- FIXED: Missing Initialize.lua in Vanilla/Wrath/Cata/MOP TOC files caused addon to fail loading
  Classic/Vanilla crash resolved - sphere now displays, /necrosis command works

- FIXED: Soulstone left-click now uses existing item instead of creating new one
  Improved usability - uses item from inventory if available, only creates if needed

COMPATIBILITY FIXES
===================
- ADDED: Compatibility wrappers for C_Container and C_Timer APIs (TBC support)
- FIXED: GetContainerItemCooldown fallback for versions that don't have this API
  Shard management, item cooldown tracking, and timers now work on all supported versions
